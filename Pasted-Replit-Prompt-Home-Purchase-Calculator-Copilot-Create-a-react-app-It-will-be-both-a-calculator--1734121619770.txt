Replit Prompt: Home Purchase Calculator Copilot

Create a react app. 

It will be both a calculator app for helping users figure out how much house they can afford. Also, there will be an AI chat bot that users can interact with. AI chat bot will have access to the users inputs into the calculator. 

## Inputs

The user will first enter “Basic inputs”:
  householdIncome,
  downPayment,
  annualInterestRate,
  loanTermYears,
  state,
  filingStatus,

And then if they want “Advanced Inputs”:
  hoaFees = 0, // Default HOA fees to $0
  homeownersInsurance = 1915, // Default Homeowners Insurance to $1,915/year
  pmiInput = null, // Optional PMI as input (annual), default to null
  propertyTaxInput = null, // Optional property tax as input (annual dollar amount), default to null
  pretaxContributions = 0,
  dependents = 0


## Outputs

I have already created a javascript function that takes the above inputs and outputs object in the following formats. You do not need to write this function.

## User Experience
Reference the Balsamiq design. Use the same style as stripe.com
When the page loads, the user should see a page with the title of the website “HowMuchHouseCanIAfford.ai” and the “basic inputs”. 
Once the user has entered in their basic inputs and pressed the “Calculate” button, display the output of the 4 different home price scenarios and the AI chat experience.


## AI Chat Experience
Only allow the user to ask 1 question to the AI before asking for them to pay $2.99 to “continue the conversation”. Collect payment via Stripe. 
On the first question to the AI limit the character count to 3000 characters. Gracefully error handle with a warning to the user if they go over 1000 characters. 
For follow up questions once the user has paid create some limit for AI usage so my app doesn’t make me go bankrupt.
