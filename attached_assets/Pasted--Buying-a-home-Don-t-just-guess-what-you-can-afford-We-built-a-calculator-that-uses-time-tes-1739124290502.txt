🏠 Buying a home? 

Don’t just guess what you can afford. 

We built a calculator that uses time-tested financial principles (shoutout to NerdWallet & MoneyUnder30) to help you stay stress-free. Here's how it works 🧵👇

First, financial principles built into the calculator:
✅ 28/36 DTI Rule (Debt-to-Income Ratio):
Front-end DTI = Mortgage payment shouldn’t be more than 28% of gross income
Back-end DTI = Total debt payments shouldn’t be more than 36% of gross income
DTI helps you measure how much of your income goes to debt. Lower is better—banks look at this to decide how much you can borrow.
✅ 50/30/20 budget:
50% needs (housing, transportation, etc.)
30% wants (fun stuff)
20% savings + debt repayment
✅ 3-4x income rule: 
Keep your home price less than 3-4x your annual income
These principles help protect your finances and prevent buyer’s remorse 🛟. Let’s dive into the process 👇

Step 1: We analyze your DTI.
Lenders typically allow a max mortgage payment of 28% of your gross income. If your back-end DTI (total debt) exceeds 8% beyond that (36% total), we lower your max mortgage payment to stay within safe limits.

Step 2: We calculate your max monthly mortgage payment based on the 28/36:
Max 28% of your gross income for mortgage 🏡
Max 36% for total debt 💳

Step 3: We calculate how much you can borrow based on that payment.
We factor in:
Down payment
Interest rate
Loan term
Property taxes, PMI, HOA fees, and insurance

Step 4: We calculate your net income.
Gross income isn’t spendable income. After taxes, Social Security, and Medicare, your real take-home pay might be much lower 💵 and is what’s used for the 50/30/20 budget rule. 

Step 5: We check if your mortgage fits the 50/30/20 rule:
50% needs (housing, transportation, insurance)
30% wants (entertainment, hobbies)
20% savings & extra debt payments 💰

Steps 6: We also run multiple budget scenarios with different savings rates of 15% and 25% in addition to the standard 20%.

This helps you see how different home prices affect your ability to save and stay flexible.

Step 7: We calculate full housing costs for each scenario:
Mortgage + property taxes + insurance + HOA fees + PMI (if needed).
You get a realistic breakdown of what's affordable—and what’s risky 🏘️.

Step 8: We bring it all together:
Max home price banks might approve 🏦
Comfortable home prices for your budget 💰
Payment breakdowns & tax implications 📊

🔑 Key takeaway:
Banks approve based on their risk assessment. We focus on your financial health. This calculator shows what you can comfortably afford without sacrificing your savings.
Avoid regret. Sleep better. Enjoy your new home. 😴🏡
